# SGL (Simple Grant Language)

Original implementation: https://github.com/evernym/sgl

The goal of this project is to implement SGL in Dart.  The  original  SGL  is  written  in
Python.

Me (ghabxph) as developer of this project, I haven't fully explored SGL. For now,  I  will
all things that I need for my other project: [ghabxph/dart_peerdid](https://github.com/ghabxph/dart_peerdid)
Later I will try to implement the original idea and provide proper documentation  so  that
this library would be easy for future consumers of this library.
